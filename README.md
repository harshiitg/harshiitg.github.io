# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this project because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them . I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://harshiitg.github.io/
